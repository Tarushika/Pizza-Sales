Objective:-
The goal of this project is to analyze pizza sales data to understand sales performance, customer preferences, and promotional impact using SQL queries. By using SQL, i made a project of Pizza Sales and I have utilized SQL queries to solve the questions. The primary objective of this project is to analyze the pizza sales data using SQL queries to uncover insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and the effectiveness of various promotions. I also utilized CTE(I also utilized CTE(Common Table Expression) to solve complex Queries.) to solve complex Queries.

Scope:-
"This project focuses on examining the database schema for pizza sales, including sales transactions, customer information, product details, and promotional activities

Methodology:- 
Database Schema: The database consists of five main tables: Orders, OrderItems, Pizzas, Customers, and Promotions. Each table is designed to capture specific aspects of the sales process, from individual orders to promotional campaigns.

Query Execution: "Using SQL, we executed a series of queries to extract and analyze data, including monthly sales trends, the most popular pizzas, customer spending patterns, and the impact of promotions.

Complex Queries: "The complexity of queries involving multiple joins and aggregations posed performance challenges. Optimization techniques, including indexing on key columns, were applied to enhance query performance. I also utilized CTE(Common Table Expression) to solve complex Queries. A Common Table Expression (CTE) is the result set of a query which exists temporarily and for use only within the context of a larger query.
Data Validation: "We validated our queries by cross-referencing the results with known data points and ensuring that all foreign key relationships were accurately maintained.

Integration:-
"Developing a real-time dashboard to continuously monitor sales performance and customer trends could offer more dynamic insights and support data-driven decision-making.
